This is just another implementation of FizzBuzz, but more dynamic. I love this little exercise. It's simple, but to the point. And if you want to, it makes you think deeper about your implementation when you start adding in edge cases.

This version uses a CFC function to generate a struct based on the divisors and a range value: ie> genString(3,5,100);
